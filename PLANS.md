# TypeFab MVP

## Context
- Repository was empty. AGENTS.md and Skills/fooping-second-brain/SKILL.md absent.
- User authorizes implementation, GitHub writes and GitHub Pages publication.

## Completion criteria
- Japanese bundled fonts and local TTF/OTF, text outlining, drag layout, shapes.
- Arbitrary rotated bridge rectangles remove real cut segments from outlined geometry.
- Automatic holding tabs and closed-contour warnings; no claim of material-strength certification.
- Fusion-style sketch workspace, mm SVG export, project save/open, undo/redo.
- Geometry tests, production build and real browser checks pass.
- GitHub Pages deployment succeeds and public URL is verified.

## Plan
1. Implement static Vite application and font assets.
2. Test clipping/outlines and browser workflows.
3. Commit/push, configure Pages, verify deployment and public app.

## Verification / remaining boundaries
- Pending implementation and validation.
- Physical laser cutting and material strength are outside browser verification.

## Implementation complete (2026-09-13)
- Static Vite editor with bundled Zen Kaku Gothic New / Shippori Mincho and OFL notices.
- TTF/OTF/WOFF local fonts, Japanese text, rotation, spacing, simple vertical arrangement, fixed outlines.
- Text/rectangle/ellipse/line creation, drag, numeric placement, duplicate/delete, undo/redo.
- Arbitrary rotated bridge rectangles, automatic holding tabs, cut preview, mm SVG.
- JSON save/open and local autosave; input validation; export blocks out-of-area geometry and fully erased contours.
- Responsive Fusion-style workspace, help, Japanese README and Pages Actions workflow.

## Validation complete
- `npm test`: 11 tests passed (geometry, real Japanese font outlines, export, import validation).
- `npm run build`: passed. `npm audit` after Vite 6.4.3 update: 0 vulnerabilities.
- Real Chromium via Playwright CLI: Japanese edit, serif selection, rotation, custom TTF upload, vertical arrangement, outline conversion and undo verified.
- Real Chromium: rectangle/ellipse/line creation, drag X=38 -> 52 mm, manual rotated bridge, duplicate/delete/undo/redo, JSON save/open verified.
- Auto bridge preview: 41 closed contours, 0 without holding gaps; downloaded SVG parsed as XML, width 240mm, no text/mask/clipPath/rect, no closed-path commands after automatic bridging.
- Desktop (1200px) and mobile (390px) screenshots inspected. Mobile document width equals viewport; toolbar scrolls horizontally by design.
- Preview server required sandbox network-listen escalation. Skill wrapper lacked CLI binary; used official `@playwright/cli` package directly.

## Publication
- Completed. See publication evidence below.

## Publication verified (2026-09-13)
- Implementation commit: `1c8f90a05c18478df56e83d41f648dc865bbbd8a`, pushed to `main`.
- GitHub Pages enabled with workflow deployment and HTTPS.
- Initial Actions run: https://github.com/fooping-tech/TypeFab/actions/runs/34749954638 — success.
- Public URL: https://fooping-tech.github.io/TypeFab/ — HTTP 200.
- Real Chromium on public URL: both bundled font assets loaded; Japanese sample rendered; automatic holding tabs and actual SVG download passed.
- Public SVG parsed and verified: 240 x 160 mm, paths only, closed contours opened by holding tabs.
- Public browser console: 0 errors, 0 warnings. Desktop screenshot inspected at 1440 x 960.
- Physical laser cutting, material connectivity/strength, kerf and downstream laser-software compatibility remain unverified, as documented in README.

## Editor expansion requested (2026-09-13)
- Preserve v1 saved projects and all current outlines while adding layers with visibility, locking, reordering, names, and object reassignment.
- Add four corner drag handles for rectangle/ellipse/outline/bridge scaling, rotation-aware opposite-corner anchoring, and persisted aspect-ratio locking (also numeric dimensions).
- Replace simple vertical arrangement with Japanese OpenType vertical shaping (vert/vrt2, punctuation, long vowel marks, vertical metrics, right-to-left columns).
- Multi-select with Shift; Union / Difference / Intersection / XOR over closed outlines. Difference uses the first selected item as the base. Preserve undo and output actual contours.
- Apply automatic bridges only to selected items; scope each generated bridge to its owner and carry it with owner transforms.
- Validate geometry, old/new JSON, vertical glyph substitution, layer behavior, and real browser interactions; deploy and verify Pages.

## Expansion implemented and validated (2026-09-13)
- Four drag handles on rectangles, ellipses, fixed outlines and bridges; opposite-corner anchoring works with rotation. Ratio lock persists and also applies to numeric dimensions; Shift temporarily locks during drag.
- Shift/Ctrl/Command multi-selection; union, difference, intersection and XOR use actual closed contours with hole preservation. Difference uses first selection as base. Empty results leave originals intact; undo restores original items.
- Named layers: creation, visibility, editing lock, front/back ordering, reassignment, safe deletion and v2 JSON persistence. v1 JSON migrates to one layer without rebuilding existing outlines. Hidden layers are excluded from cut checks/export; visible locked layers still export.
- SVG includes visible named layer groups and Inkscape layer metadata, retaining mm cut paths.
- HarfBuzz vertical shaping uses vert/vrt2, vertical advances and offsets, right-to-left columns; tests verify brackets, punctuation and long-vowel substitutions in both bundled fonts. WOFF unpacking preserves original OpenType tables. Ruby, tate-chu-yoko, kinsoku and rotated Latin typesetting are not implemented.
- Automatic bridges apply only to selected owner IDs. They follow owner translation/rotation/resizing without changing physical tab width, move between layers with owners, duplicate with owners and delete with owners. Legacy/manual bridges remain global.

### Expansion verification
- `npm test`: 28 tests passed, including 17 added operation/layer/vertical/WOFF/export tests.
- Production build passed; HarfBuzz WASM loaded correctly from the built `/TypeFab/` asset path in real Chromium. Build emits an expected externalization notice for the HarfBuzz Node-only module branch; browser console has 0 errors and 0 warnings.
- Real browser: drag rectangle 40x20 -> 70x35 with ratio lock; numeric width 80 updates height to 40.
- Real browser: Shift-select rectangle/ellipse -> difference with preserved hole; two scoped tabs survive owner movement and saved JSON validation.
- Real browser: layer rename, reassignment, lock preventing selection, hide yielding 0 rendered objects, reorder and undo verified.
- Real browser: true vertical serif text `「日本語ー。」\n縦書き` visually inspected; JSON v1 import, v2 import and autosave reload passed.
- Downloaded SVG parsed as XML: two named layer groups, 240mm width, paths only; no text/masks/clipping rectangles.
- Desktop and 390px mobile screenshots inspected; mobile document width equals viewport width.
- README now documents the features, selection ordering, saved-project migration and remaining typography/manufacturing boundaries.
- Publication pending for this expansion; previous v0.1 URL remains https://fooping-tech.github.io/TypeFab/.
